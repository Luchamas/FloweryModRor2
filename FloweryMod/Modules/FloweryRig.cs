    /// frozen upright underneath him. Read out of the game, that meant:
    ///
    /// - Loader's main hurtbox is a fixed capsule on the rig, spanning body height -0.89 to 1.63.
    ///   Flowery hovers: in his own pose his toes are near 0 and his head near 2. So the capsule
    ///   stopped at his chest, his head could not be hit at all, and nothing followed his lean.
    /// - The body's core - the point shields, burns and every other effect around a character
    ///   are centred on - is Loader's chest bone, set through CharacterBody.overrideCoreTransform.
    ///   Frozen, that sits 0.85 up the body, around Flowery's thighs. That is why the Rose Buckler
    ///   shield trailed around his legs. The override is now cleared, so the core is the centre
    ///   of his own body hurtbox (see CentreCoreOnHurtBox).
    /// - Loader's weak point (the Railgunner sniper target) sat on Flowery's chest.
    /// - The ChildLocator named Loader's bones, so anything asking for "Head" or "HandL" got a
    ///   point on the frozen skeleton.
